                <p>Hi, I'm Kellin Baldenegro. I'm 29 years old from from Phoenix, AZ. I began my technology career attending the University of Arizona Continuing and Professional Education Coding Program. It was there that I became a true software engineer. Although I had spent half a year of self-study before enrollment into the bootcamp it was there that I gained the real world skills necesssary to perform in the business of computers.
                <br><br>
                I'm innately curious, a hardworker, innovative and inventive. I want to know how things work, I'm willing to do what it takes to get the job done, and I'm always looking for ways to do things better and smarter.</p>
